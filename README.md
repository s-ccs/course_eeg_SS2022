# EEG Preprocessing and analysis [SS2022]
Welcome to the practical part of the EEG course.
- You can find information on the semesterproject in `./semesterproject`
- You can find the exercises in `./exercises`
- Data will be saved to `./local` by default, but can be changed

### Some Comments
- The lectures are in ILIAS
- You are highly welcome to our discussion on Monday 11.30, see ILIAS.
- I highly recommend to do the exercises, given that the semesterproject will make heavy use of the skills you learned here. You have typically 1 week time for the homeworks. They are not obligatory.
- If you want feedback, please indicate it at the top of your notebook.

### Found a mistake?
- I am happy to take pull-requests on the exercises!
